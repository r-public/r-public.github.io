          <hr />

          <p id='q1'><strong>Question 1. Can I ask any R related question here?</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Answer 1. You are most welcome to ask any question</strong></p>

          <p>Follow the simple steps mentioned <a href="http://r-public.github.io/#ask">on the main page</a>. Additional guidelines include </p>

          <ol>
          <li>Do not be a help vampire. See <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19665/the-help-vampire-problem">The Help Vampire Problem</a></li>
          <li>Use a code pasting service for long codes. If you are familiar with fiddles, then <a href="http://www.r-fiddle.org/">R-Fiddle</a> is your friend here. </li>
          <li>Format your code properly. This can be done by selecting the entire message and clicking on <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> or by clicking on the <kbd>fixed font</kbd> button next to the area where you type your message. </li>
          <li>Do not annoy those who try to help you. Using excessive @ pings is pushing the user to answer your question which might lower the chance of you getting an answer.</li>
          <li>If you don't get an answer do not ask the same question again and again. It'll be a futile attempt. </li>
          </ol>

          <hr />

          <p id='q2'><strong>Question 2. I have asked a new question on the main site, Can I link it here?</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Answer 2. No, Please Don't</strong></p>

          <p>Do Not link your recently asked questions here. Wait for a day or two before linking here. This is because </p>

          <ol>
          <li>The users of the room will already have taken a look at your question as we all keep an active tab of the incoming [r] questions. </li>
          <li>The users of the room will have an undue advantage over the other general answerers as they have an oppurtunity to chat with you.</li>
          <li>Depending on your question, it may recieve a flood of downvotes and close votes. </li>
          </ol>

          <hr />

          <p id='q3'><strong>Question 3. Can I help moderate the [r] Stack Overflow tag here?</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Answer 3. Depends on you</strong></p>

          <p>There are other rooms that are set up with the sole thought of moderating tags in general and the [r] tag in specific. A few of them are gallery rooms where you need permission to post. In R Public, the modertion practice is quite limited and is not on the room agenda. The sole purpose of the room is to help new users with their R related questions. However the following are permitted</p>

          <ol>
          <li>If you are a low rep user and do not have access to the other rooms then you can certainly drop a link here. Depending on the severity the link may be moved to other rooms. In such a case you will get a room invite notification. Kindly ignore that. </li>
          <li>If you are unable to understand a question, then you can ask here. We will gladly help you to either understand that problem or close that question as unclear. </li>
          <li>NAA/Spam/Offensive answer links are allowed as they need quick and immediate attention. However do not one-box such answers as they remain in the transcript forever. </li>
          </ol>
